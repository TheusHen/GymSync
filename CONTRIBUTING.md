Thank you for your interest in contributing to **GymSync**! This project is open source and I welcome contributions of all kinds â€” bug reports, feature requests, code improvements, and more.

   * Set up the desktop Presence client.
3. Make sure you keep Discord open and running while testing the Presence app.

## About the Project

I built GymSync in just 3 days while improving my Flutter and Dart skills. To be honest, I chose Flutter partly to avoid Java and Kotlin for now, but I plan to learn more about Android development in the future and create even more powerful apps.

Your help in making this project better is highly appreciated!
