With this project I greatly improved my skills with Flutter and Dart, but I still have to admit that I used Flutter to avoid Java and Kotlin, which would be ideal. I hope to study more in the future and create much more powerful projects with Android Studio.

If you find any errors, feel free to open an Issue. By the way, I created this project in 3 days btw lol.
