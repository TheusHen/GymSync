# Disclaimer!

In the `/presence` and `/mobile_app` folders, default CLIENT-IDs have already been set. You do not necessarily need to create your own bot or define assets, URIs, etc.â€”you can simply use the provided CLIENT-ID. Note that the CLIENT-ID is completely different from the token: it can be shared and is only used to invite the bot.
